<t>This memo describes a prefix assignment mechanism for home
networks. It is expected that home gateway routers are allocated an
IPv6 prefix through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) or that a prefix is
made available through other means. This prefix needs to be divided
among the multiple subnets in a home network. This memo describes a
mechanism for such division, or assignment, via OSPFv3.  This is an
alternative design to also using DHCPv6 PD for the assignment. The
memo is input to the working group so that it can make a decision on
which type of design to pursue. It is expected that a routing-protocol

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>This memo describes a prefix assignment mechanism for home
networks. It is expected that home gateway routers are allocated an
IPv6 prefix through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) <xref
target="RFC3633"/>, or that a prefix is made available by some other
means. Manual configuration may be needed in some networks, for
instance when the ISP does not support DHCPv6-based prefix
delegation. In other cases, such as networks that have do not yet have
an Internet connection, Unique Local Address (ULA) <xref
target="RFC4193"/> prefixes can be automatically generated. For the purposes of
this document, we refer to the prefix reserved for a home network
as a prefix allocation.</t>

<t>A prefix allocation needs to be divided among the multiple subnets
in a home network. For the purposes of this document, we refer to this
process as prefix assignment. This memo describes a mechanism for
prefix assignment via OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5340"/>.</t>

<t>The OSPv3-based mechanism is an alternative design to also using DHCPv6
PD for the prefix assignment in the internal network.  This memo
has been written so that the working group can make a decision on
which type of design to pursue. The main benefit of using a routing
protocol to handle the prefix assignment is that it can provide a more
efficient use of address space than hierarchical assignment through
DHCPv PD. This may be important for home networks that only get a /60
prefix allocation from their ISPs.</t>

<t>The rest of this memo is organized as follows. <xref target="kwd"/>
defines the usual keywords, <xref target="role"/> explains the main
requirements for prefix assignments, <xref target="router"/> describes
how a home gateway router makes assignments when it itself has
multiple subnets, and <xref target="design"/> and <xref
target="painospf"/> describe how the assignment can be performed in a
distributed manner via OSPFv3 in the entire home network. Finally,
<xref target="ula"/> specifies the procedures for automatic generation
of ULA prefixes, <xref target="hyst"/> explains the hysteresis
principles applied to prefix assignment and de-assignment, <xref
target="manag"/> explains what administrative interfaces are useful
for advanced users that wish to manually interact with the mechanisms,
<xref target="sec"/> discusses the security aspects of the design,
<xref target="iana"/> explains the necessary IANA actions, and <xref
target="const"/> defines the necessary timer constants.</t>

<t>An analysis of a mechanism reminiscent of the one described in this
specification has been published in the SIGCOMM IPv6 Workshop <xref
target="SIGCOMM.IPV6"/>. Further analysis is encouraged.</t>

<section anchor="role" title="Role of Prefix Assignment">

<t>Given a prefix shorter than /64 for the entire home network, this
prefix needs to be subdivided so that every subnet is given its own
/64 prefix. In many cases there will be just one subnet, the internal
network interface attached to the router. But it is also common to
have two or more internal network interfaces with intentionally separate
networks. For instance, "private" and "guest" SSIDs are automatically
configured in many current home network routers. When all the network
interfaces that require a prefix are attached to the same router, the
prefix assignment problem is simple, and procedures outlined in <xref
target="router"/> can be employed.</t>

<t>In a more complex setting there are multiple routers in the
internal network. There are various possible reasons why this might be
necessary <xref target="I-D.ietf-homenet-arch"/>. For instance,
networks that cannot be bridged together should be routed, speed
differences between wired and wireless interfaces make the use of the
same broadcast domain undesirable, or simply that router devices keep
being added. In any case, it then becomes necessary to assign prefixes
across the entire network, and this assignment can no longer be done
on a local basis as proposed in <xref target="router"/>. A distributed
mechanism and a protocol are required.</t>

<t>The key requirements for this distributed mechanism are as follows.

<list style="symbols">

<t>A prefix allocated to a home gateway router within the home network
is used to assign /64 prefixes on each subnet that requires one.

<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Note that several methods may be used to allocate such an aggregated prefix.</t>

<t>The assignment mechanism should provide reasonable efficiency.  As
a practical benchmark, some ISPs may employ /60 allocations to
individual subscribers. As a result, the assignment mechanism should
avoid wasting too many prefixes so that this set of 16 /64 prefixes
is not exhausted in the foreseeable future for commonly occurring
network configurations.</t>

<t>In particular, the assignment of multiple prefixes to the same
network from the same top-level prefix must be avoided.

<list style="empty">

<t>Example: When a home network consists of a home gateway router
connected to another router which in turn is connected to hosts, a
minimum of two /64 prefixes are required in the internal network: one
between the two routers, and another one for the host-side interface
on the second router. But an ineffective assignment mechanism in the
two routers might have both of them asking for separate assignments for this
shared interface.</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>The assignments must be stable across reboots, power cycling,
router software updates, and preferably, should be stable across
simple network changes. Simple network changes are in this case
defined as those that could be resolved through either
deletion or addition of a prefix assignment. For instance, the
addition of a new router without changing connections between existing
routers requires just the assignment of new prefixes for the new
networks that the router introduces.  There are no stability
requirements across more complex types of network reconfiguration
events. For instance, if a network is separated into two networks
connected by a newly inserted router, this may lead to renumbering
all networks within the home.</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>In an even more complex setting there may be multiple home gateway
routers and multiple connections to ISP(s). These cases are analogous
to the case of a single gateway router. Each gateway will simply
distribute the prefix it has, and participating routers throughout the
network may assign themselves prefixes from several gateways.
Multiple assignments can be made for the same interface.  For example,
this can be useful in a multi-homing setting.</t>

<t>Similarly, it is also possible that it is necessary to assign either
a global prefix delegated from the ISP or a local, Unique Local
Address (ULA) prefix <xref target="RFC4193"/>. The mechanisms in this
memo are applicable to both types of prefixes. The details of the generation of
ULA-based prefixes is covered in <xref target="ula"/>.</t>

<t>The mechanisms in this memory can also be used in standalone or ad
hoc networks where no global prefixes or Internet connectivity are
available, by distributing ULA prefixes within the network.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="router" title="Router Behavior">

<t>This section describes how a router assigns prefixes to its
directly connected interfaces. We assume that the router has prefix
allocation(s) that it can use for this assignment. Each such prefix
allocation is called an aggregated prefix. Parts of the aggregated prefix may
already be assigned for some purpose; a coordinated assignment from
the prefix is necessary before it can actually be assigned to an
interface.</t>

<t>Even if the assignment process is local, it still needs to follow
the requirements from <xref target="role"/>. This is achieved through the
following rules:

<list style="symbols">

<t>The router MUST maintain a list of assigned prefixes on a
per-interface basis. The contents of this list consists of prefixes
that the router itself has assigned to the interface, as well as
prefixes assigned to the interface by other routers. The latter are
learned through the mechanisms described in <xref target="painospf"/>,
when they are used. Each prefix is associated with the Router ID of the	
router that assigned it.</t>

<t>Whenever the router finds a combination of an interface and aggregated
prefix that is not used on the interface, it SHOULD make a new prefix
assignment. That is, the router checks to see if an
interface and aggregated prefix exists such that there are no assigned prefixes
within that interface that are more specific than the aggregated
prefix. In this situation the router makes an allocation from the
aggregated prefix (if possible) and adds the assignment to the list of
assigned prefixes on that interface.

<list style="empty">
<t>Note: The above implies that when there are multiple aggregated prefixes,
each network will be assigned multiple prefixes.</t>
</list></t>

<t>An assignment from an aggregated prefix MUST be checked against possible
other assignments from the same aggregated prefix on the same link by
neighboring routers, to avoid unnecessary assignments. Assignments
MUST also be examined against all existing assignments from the same
aggregated prefix across the network, to avoid collisions. Assignments are
made for individual /64 prefixes. The choice of a /64 prefix among multiple
free ones MUST be made randomly or based on an algorithm that takes
unique hardware characteristics of the router and the interface into
account. This helps avoid collisions when simultaneous assignments are
made within a network.</t>

<t>In order to provide a stable assignment, the router MUST store
assignments affecting directly connected interfaces and automatically
generated ULA prefixes in non-volatile memory and attempt to re-use
them in the future when possible.  At least the 5 most recent
assignments SHOULD be stored. Note that this applies to both its own
assignments as well as assignments made by others. This ensures that
the same prefix assignments are made regardless of the order that
different devices are brought up.  To avoid attacks on flash memory
write cycles, assignments made by others SHOULD be recorded only after
10 minutes have passed and the assignment is still valid.</t>

<t>Re-using a memorized assignment is possible when a
aggregated prefix exists that is less specific than the prefix in the assignment
(or it is the prefix itself in the assignment), and the prefix is
currently unassigned.</t>

</list>
</t>

<section title="Sending Router Advertisements">

<t>Once the router has assigned a prefix to an interface, it MUST act
as a router as defined in <xref target="RFC4861"/> and advertise the
prefix in Router Advertisements. The lifetime of the prefix SHOULD be
advertised as a reasonably long period, at least 48 hours or the
lifetime of the assigned prefixes, whichever is smaller.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="dnsdisc" title="DNS Discovery">

<t>To support a variety of IPv6-only hosts in these networks, the
router needs to ensure that sufficient DNS discovery mechanisms are
enabled. It is RECOMMENDED that both stateless DHCPv6 <xref
target="RFC3736"/> and Router Advertisement options <xref
target="RFC6106"/> are supported and turned on by default in routers.</t>

<t>The above requires, however, that a working DNS server is known and
addressable via IPv6. The mechanism in <xref target="RFC3736"/> and
<xref target="RFC3646"/> can be used for this. It is RECOMMENDED that
each router attempts to discover an existing DNS server. Typically,
such a server will be provided by an ISP. However, in some cases no such server
can be found. For instance, an ISP may provide only IPv4 DNS server addresses,
or a router deep within the home network is unaware of the IPv6 DNS servers that a home gateway router has discovered.
In these situations it is RECOMMENDED that each router turns on a local DNS relay that
fetches information from the IPv4 Internet (if a working IPv4 DNS server is available) or
a full DNS server that fetches information from the DNS root.</t>

<t>As a result of these recommendations, as long as there is
reachability to at least the Internet, every router within the home
network will either know the IPv6 address of a DNS server or it itself
runs a server that can fetch information from the Internet. As a
result, the router can provide information about the server address to
hosts in directly connected networks.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="design" title="Design Choices">

<section title="DNS Discovery">

<t>The DNS discovery recommendations in <xref target="dnsdisc"/>
ensure that an IPv6-only home network can resolve names. However,
these recommendations are suboptimal in the sense that different
routers in the home may provide different DNS servers, or multiple
local DNS servers have to be run where it would have been possible to
point to one, or even point to the one provided by the ISP. However,
better coordination for the DNS server selection would require some
form of additional communication between the routers in the home
network. The authors solicit opinions from the Working Group on
whether this is something that should be specified. However, the
current design is easy to deploy even when not all routers within the
network support Homenet specifications yet; the mechanism provides an
incremental improvement to IPv6 DNS reachability even when the first
Homenet router is deployed.</t>

</section>

<section title="Prefix Assignment">

<t>The OSPFv3-based prefix assignment protocol needs to detect two
types of conflicts:

<list style="numbers">

<t>Two or more OSPFv3 routers have assigned the same IPv6 prefix for
different networks.</t>

<t>Two or more OSPFv3 routers have assigned different IPv6 prefixes
for the same network.</t>

</list>

Several design decisions were needed to construct the protocol:

<list style="numbers">

<t>How to determine the winner in case of a conflict? 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The algorithm in <xref target="painospf"/> ensures that the OSPFv3
Router with the numerically lower OSPFv3 Router ID removes its
assignment and schedules an advertisement of LSAs that no longer
describe such an assignment. That is, the router with the highest Router ID
wins in a conflict situation.</t>

<t>How to ensure that a network-wide conflict can be detected?
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
We chose to define new LSA extensions -- TLVs within the new Autoconfiguration
LSA -- that are flooded throughout the network.  Another possible
design would have been to re-use existing OSPFv3 LSAs, and by assuming
that if a router advertises a prefix then it has made an
assignment. The advantage of the design that we chose is that we get
to specify what information is needed in the new TLVs. This is
particularly important, as not all existing OSPFv3 LSAs are
extensible. A downside is that assignments will not be visible, unless
the router using an assignment implements this specification and advertises
the new LSAs.  Had we reused existing LSAs, a manual assignment for a
legacy router could have been handled, as the legacy router would have
advertised the prefix assigned to it.</t>

<t>How to ensure that both local and network-wide conflicts can be detected?
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
We chose to employ the same new Autoconfiguration LSA TLVs for this
purpose, and correlate neighbors through the Router IDs and Interface
IDs that they advertise in these TLVs. The OSPFv3 Router with a
numerically lower OSPFv3 Router ID should accept the global IPv6
prefix from the neighbor with the highest OSPFv3 Router ID.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor="painospf" title="Prefix Assignment in OSPFv3">

<t>This section describes how prefix assignment in a home network can
be performed in a distributed manner via OSPFv3. It is expected that
the router already support the auto-configuration extensions defined
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/>.</t>

<t>An overview of OSPFv3-based prefix assignment is as follows.
OSPFv3 routers that are capable of auto-configuration advertise an OSPFv3
Auto-Configuration (AC) LSA <xref
target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/> with suitable TLVs.  For
prefix assignment, two TLVs are used. The Aggregated Prefix TLV (<xref
target="aggregatedprefixtlv"/>) advertises an aggregated prefix, usually the
prefix that has been delegated to the home gateway router from the ISP
through DHCPv6 PD. These aggregated prefixes are necessary for running
the algorithm in <xref target="router"/> for determining whether prefix
assignments can and should be made.</t>

<t>The Assigned Prefix TLV (<xref target="assignedprefixtlv"/>)
is used to communicate assignments that routers make out of the
aggregated prefixes.</t>

<t>An assignment can be made when the algorithm in <xref
target="router"/> indicates that it can be made and no other router
has claimed the same assignment. The router makes an OSPFv3
advertisement with the Assigned Prefix TLV included to let other
devices know that the prefix is now in use. Unfortunately, collisions
are still possible, when the algorithms on different routers happen to
choose the same free /64 prefix or when more /64 prefixes are needed
than are available. This situation is detected through an
advertisement where a different router claims the assignment of the
same prefix. In this situation the router with the numerically lower
OSPFv3 Router ID has to select another prefix and immediately withdraw
any assignments and advertisements that may have been advertised in
OSPFv3. See also Section 5.2 in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/>.</t>

<section anchor="aggregatedprefixtlv" title="Aggregated Prefix TLV">

   <t>The Aggregated Prefix TLV is defined for the OSPFv3
   Auto-Configuration (AC) LSA <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/>. It will have type
   TBD-BY-IANA-1 and MUST be advertised in the LSID OSPFv3 AC LSA with
   an LSID of 0.  It MAY occur once or multiple times and the
   information from all TLV instances is retained. The length of the
   TLV is variable.</t>

   <t>The contents of the TLV include an aggregated prefix (Prefix) and
   prefix length (PrefixLength).  PrefixLength is the length in bits of the prefix
   and is an 8-bit field. The PrefixLength MUST be greater than or equal
   to 8 and less than or equal to 64. The prefix describes an
   allocation of a global or ULA prefix for the entire auto-configured
   home network. The Prefix is
   an encoding of the prefix itself as an even multiple of 32-bit words,
   padding with zero bits as necessary.  This encoding consumes
   (PrefixLength + 31) / 32) 32-bit words and is consistent with
   <xref target="RFC5340"/>. It MUST NOT be directly assigned to any
   interface before
   following the procedures defined in this memo.</t>

   <t>This TLV SHOULD be advertised by every home gateway router that has
   either a manual, DHCPv6 PD-based, or generated ULA prefix that is
   shorter than /64.</t>

   <t>This TLV MUST appear inside an OSPFv3 Router Auto-Configuration
   LSA, and only in combination with the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint
   TLV <xref target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/> Section 5.2.2
   in the same LSA.</t>

<section anchor="prefixassign" title="OSPFv3 Prefix Assignment">
<t>OSPFv3 Routers supporting the mechanisms in the memo will learn or 
assign a global /64 IPv6 prefix for each IPv6 interface. 
Since the mechanisms described herein are based on OSPFv3, Router ID assignment
as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/> MUST have
completed successfully.</t>

<t>When an OSPFv3 Router receives a global prefix through DHCPv6 prefix 
delegation, manual configuration, or other means, it SHOULD advertise this
prefix by including the Aggregated Prefix TLV in its OSPFv3 AC LSA. This will 
trigger prefix assignment for auto-configured OSPFv3 routers within
the routing domain including the originating OSPFv3 router.

<list style="empty">

<t>Discussion: Note that while having multiple routers advertise the
same aggregated address space (or address space that covers another
router's aggregated address space) is a configuration error, it should not
result in any adverse effects, as long as assignments from such space
are still checked for collisions against all other assignments from
the same address space.</t>

</list></t> 

<t>When an OSPFv3 Router detects a change in the set of AC LSAs in its
LSA database, it will run the prefix assignment algorithm. The purpose
of this algorithm is to determine, for each Aggregated Prefix in the
database, whether or not a new prefix needs to be assigned for each of
its attached IPv6 interfaces and whether or not existing assignments
need to be deprecated. The algorithm also detects and removes
assignments for which there is no longer a corresponding Aggregated
Prefix. Before the algorithm is run, all existing assignments in
assigned prefix lists for directly connected interfaces must be marked as
"invalid" and will be deleted at the end of the algorithm if they are still
in this state. An assigned prefix is considered to be "valid" if all
the following conditions are met:

<list style="symbols">

   <t>A containing Aggregated Prefix TLV exists in reachable AC LSA(s).</t>

   <t>An Assigned Prefix TLV that matches this assignment exactly
   (same prefix, same router and interface ID associated with the
   assignment) exist in reachable AC LSA(s).</t>

   <t>Any router advertising an assignment for the same link and
   Aggregated Prefix has a lower Router ID than the source of this
   assignment.</t>

   <t>If this router is the source of the assignment, any router in
   the network that has assigned the same prefix on a different link
   has a lower Router ID than this router.</t>

</list></t>

   <t>Note that this definition of a "valid assignment" depends on the
   router running the algorithm: in particular, a router is not expected
   to detect prefix collisions or duplicate prefix assignments that do
   not concern assignments for which it is the responsible router. It is
   the role of the responsible router to detect these cases and update
   its AC LSAs accordingly. A router is, however, expected to react to
   these updates from other routers which translate into additions or
   removals of Aggregated Prefix or Assigned Prefix TLVs.</t>

   <t>The router is expected to have made a snapshot of the LSA database
   before running this algorithm. The prefix assignment algorithm
   consists of the following steps run once per combination of Aggregated
   Prefix in the LSA database and directly connected OSPFv3 interface. For the
   purposes of this discussion, the Aggregated Prefix will be referred to as
   the Current Aggregated Prefix, and the interface will be referred to as
   the Current Interface. The following steps will be performed for each
   tuple (Aggregated Prefix, OSPFv3 interface):

   <list style="numbers">

   <t>The OSPFv3 Router will search all AC LSAs for an Aggregated Prefix TLV
       describing a prefix which contains but is not equal to the
       Current Aggregated Prefix. If such a prefix is found, the algorithm
       is skipped for the Current Aggregated Prefix as it either has or will
       be run for the shorter prefix.</t>

   <t>The OSPFv3 router will examine its list of neighbors to find all
       neighbors in state greater than Init (these neighbors will be
       referred to as active neighbors).</t>

   <t>The following three steps will serve to determine whether an
       assignment needs to be made on the link:
 
      <list style="hanging">

       <t hangText="i."><vspace blankLines="1"/>The OSPFv3 router will determine whether or not
       it has the highest Router ID of all active OSPFv3 routers on
       the link.</t>

       <t hangText="ii."><vspace blankLines="1"/>If OSPFv3 active neighbors are present on the
       link, the router will determine whether any of them have
       already assigned an IPv6 prefix.  This is done by examining the
       AC LSAs of all the active neighbors on the link and looking for
       any that include an Assigned Prefix TLV with the same OSPFv3
       Router ID and Interface ID as the neighbor has. If one is found
       and it is a subnet of the IPv6 prefix advertised in the Aggregated
       Prefix TLV, the router stores this prefix and the Router ID of
       the router advertising it for reference in the next step. If
       several such prefixes are found, only the prefix and Router ID 
       with the numerically highest Router ID are stored.</t>

       <t hangText="iii."><vspace blankLines="1"/>The router will compare its Router ID with
       the highest Router ID among neighbors which have made an
       assignment on the link.  If it is higher (or if no assignments
       have been made by any neighbors), it will determine whether or
       not it is already the source of an assignment for the Current
       Interface from the Current Aggregated Prefix.</t>

      </list></t>

   <t>There are four possibilities at this stage:

       <list style="symbols">
       <t>The router has already made an assignment on the link and
       has a higher Router ID than all eventual neighbors which have
       also made an assignment. In this case, the router's existing
       assignment takes precedence over all other eventual existing
       assignments on the link, but the router must determine whether
       its assignment is still valid throughout the whole
       network. This is described in <xref target="alg-valid"/>.</t>

       <t>An assignment has been made by a neighbor on the link, and
       the router either has not made an assignment on the link, or
       has a lower Router ID than the neighbor. In this case, the
       neighbor's assignment takes precedence over all eventual
       existing assignments on the link (including assignments made by
       the router), and the router must update the assigned prefix
       list of the Current Interface as well as check assignments on
       other interfaces for potential collisions.  This is described
       in <xref target="alg-local"/>.</t>

       <t>No assignment has been made by anyone on the link, and the
       router has the highest Router ID on the link. In this case, it
       must make an assignment from the Current Aggregated Prefix.  This
       is described in <xref target="alg-new"/>.</t>

       <t>No assignment has been made by anyone on the link, and the
       router does not have the highest Router ID on the link. In this
       case, the algorithm exits as the router is not responsible for
       prefix assignment on the link.</t>

       </list></t>
     </list></t>

<t>Once the algorithm has been run for each Aggregated Prefix and each
interface, the router must delete all assignments that are not marked
as valid on all assigned prefix lists and deprecate the corresponding
addresses. If this leads to deleting an assignment that this router
was responsible for, or if AC LSA origination was scheduled during the
algorithm, it must originate a new AC LSA advertising the changes.
The router MUST also deprecate deleted prefixes as specified in <xref
target="alg-deprecate"/>.</t>

<section anchor="alg-new" title="Making a New Assignment">

<t>This procedure is executed when no assignment exists on the link
and the router is responsible for making an assignment. The router
MUST:

<list style="numbers">

       <t>Examine all the AC LSAs not advertised by this router that
       include Assigned Prefix TLVs that are subnets of the Current
       Aggregated Prefix, as well as all assignments made by this router,
       to determine which prefixes are already assigned.</t>

       <t>Examine former prefix assignments stored in non-volatile
       storage for the interface.  Starting with the most recent
       assignment, if the prefix is both a subnet of the Current
       Aggregated Prefix and is currently unassigned, reuse the assignment
       for the interface.</t>

       <t>If no unused former prefix assignment is found, and an 
       unassigned /64 subnet of the Current Aggregated Prefix exists,
       assign that prefix to the interface.</t>

       <t>If no OSPFv3 neighbors have been discovered and previous
       prefix assignments exist, the router can make the
       assignments immediately. Otherwise, the hysteresis periods
       specified in <xref target="hyst"/> are applied before making an
       assignment.</t>

       <t>In the event that no assignment could be made to the
       interface, a warning must be raised. However, the router MUST
       remain in a state where it continues to assign prefixes through
       OSPFv3, as prefixes may later become available.</t>

       <t>Once a global IPv6 prefix is assigned, the router will mark
       it as valid and schedule re-origination of the AC LSA including
       the Assigned Prefix TLV once all Aggregated
       Prefixes and interfaces have been examined.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section anchor="alg-valid" title="Checking for Conflicts Across the Entire Network">

<t>This procedure is executed for every assignment that the router
intends to make or retain as the router responsible for an assignment.</t>

<t>The router MUST verify that this assignment is still valid across
the whole network. This assigned prefix will be referred to as the
Current Assigned Prefix. The router will search for a reachable 
AC LSA in the LSA database that is advertised by a router with 
a higher Router ID and contains an Assigned Prefix equal to the Current Assigned
Prefix. If such an LSA is found, it needs to be deprecated as
described in <xref target="alg-deprecate"/>. Otherwise, the router
will mark its assignment as valid.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="alg-deprecate" title="Deprecating an Assigned Prefix">

<t>This procedure is executed when the router's earlier assignment of
a prefix can no longer be used. The following steps MUST be followed:

<list style="numbers">

<t>If the the prefix was in an interface's assigned prefix list, it is
removed.</t>

<t>If this router was the source of the prefix assignment, schedule 
re-origination of the modified AC LSA once the algorithm
has finished.</t>

<t>The router MUST also deprecate the prefix, if it had been
advertised in Router Advertisements on an interface. The prefix is
deprecated by sending Router Advertisements with the lifetime set to 0
<xref target="RFC4861"/> for the prefix in question.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section anchor="alg-local" title="Verifying and Making a Local Assignment">

<t>This procedure is executed when an assignment by a neighbor already
exists, and takes precedence over all other assignments on the
link. The router must check whether or not it is already aware of this
assignment. It will search for the assigned prefix matching the
neighbor's assignment and Router ID in the Current Interface's
assigned prefix list. If it is already present, the router will mark
it as valid.  Otherwise, the router will check that no assignment on
any directly connected interface collides with the neighbor's
assignment. If a collision is found and the colliding prefix takes
priority over the neighbor's assignment (higher Router ID), the router
will silently ignore the neighbor's assignment. If a collision is
found but the neighbor's assignment takes priority, the old assignment
is removed as described in <xref target="alg-deprecate"/>.
If the neighbor's assignment takes priority, or if no collision was found, 
the router will provision the interface with the prefix, add it to the list of
assigned prefixes using the neighbor's Router ID and mark it as
valid.</t>

<section anchor="ula" title="ULA Generation">

<t>For ULA-based prefixes, it is necessary to elect a router as the
generator of such prefixes, have it perform the generation, and then
employ the prefixes for local interfaces and the entire router
network. This section specifies these procedures, and recommends the
generation of ULAs when no connectivity can be established
otherwise. However, the use of ULAs in parallel with global IPv6
prefixes is outside the scope of this memo. The mechanisms in this
memo could be used for that as well.</t>

<t>When an OSPFv3 Router detects a change in the set of AC LSAs in its
LSA database, it will run the ULA generation algorithm. The purpose of
this algorithm is to determine whether a new ULA prefix needs to be
generated. There is no need for this router to generate a new ULA
prefix when any of the following conditions are met:

<list style="hanging">

   <t hangText="i."><vspace blankLines="1"/>An Aggregated Prefix TLV exists in an
   AC LSA advertised by a reachable router in the LSA database, with either global
   or ULA address space.</t>

   <t hangText="ii."><vspace blankLines="1"/>A reachable router in the OSPFv3 topology 
   with a higher Router ID than this OSPFv3 router exists.</t>

   <t hangText="iii."><vspace blankLines="1"/>This router has
   assignments from either IPv4 or IPv6 global address space on any
   interface, or there is connectivity to the global Internet.

   <list style="empty">
   <t>Discussion: This rule is necessary in order to prevent
   autoconfiguration-capable routers from unnecessarily creating ULA
   address space in networks where autoconfiguration is not in
   use. Similarly, from an IPv6 "happy eyeballs" perspective it is
   desirable to not create local islands of IPv6 connectivity when
   there is IPv4 connectivity (even through a NAT).</t>
   </list></t>

</list></t>

<t>If none of the above conditions are met after applying the
hysteresis principles from <xref target="hyst"/>, the router SHOULD
perform the following actions:

<list style="numbers">

<t>Generate a new 48-bit ULA prefix as specified in <xref
target="RFC4193"/>, Section 3.2.</t>

<t>Record the new prefix in stable storage, per rules in <xref
target="router"/>.</t>

<t>Advertise the new prefix allocation in OSPFv3 as specified in <xref
target="prefixassign"/>.</t>

<t>Assign /64 prefixes from the new prefix for its own use, as a part
of the general algorithm for making prefix assignments (also in <xref
target="prefixassign"/>).</t>

</list></t>

<t>If the router has made such an allocation, it SHOULD continue to
advertise the prefix in OSPFv3 for as long as conditions i) through
iii) do not apply, with the exception of the generated ULA
prefix that this router is advertising.</t>

<t>If the router has made such an allocation, and any of the
conditions become true (except for the case of the ULA prefix that the
router is advertising) even after applying the hysteresis principles
from <xref target="hyst"/>, then the OSPFv3 router SHOULD withdraw the
advertisement for the aggregated prefix. This is done by scheduling the
re-origination of an AC LSA that does not include the Aggregated Prefix TLV
with the ULA. Note that as a result of the general algorithm for
making prefix assignments, any /64 prefix assignments from the ULA
prefix will eventually be deprecated.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="hyst" title="Hysteresis">

<t>A network may experience temporary connectivity problems, routing
protocol convergence may take time, and a set of devices may be coming
up at the same time due to power being turned on in a synchronous
manner. Due to these reasons it is important that the prefix
allocation and assignment mechanisms do not react before the situation
is allowed to stabilize. To allow for this, a hysteresis principle is
applied to new or withdrawn automatically generated prefixes and
prefix assignments.</t>

<t>A new automatically generated ULA prefix SHOULD NOT be allocated
before the router has waited NEW_ULA_PREFIX seconds for another prefix
or reachable OSPFv3 router to appear. See <xref target="const"/> for the specific
time value.</t>

<t>A previously automatically generated ULA prefix SHOULD NOT be taken
out of use before the router has waited TERMINATE_ULA_PREFIX
seconds.</t>

<t>A new prefix assignment within an aggregated prefix SHOULD NOT be
committed before the router has waited NEW_PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT seconds for
another prefix or reachable OSPFv3 router to appear. Note the exceptions to this
rule in <xref target="alg-new"/>, item 4.</t>

<t>A previously assigned prefix SHOULD NOT be taken out of use
before the router has waited TERMINATE_PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT
seconds.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="manag" title="Manageability Considerations">

<t>Advanced users may wish to manage their networks without
automation, and there may also be situations where manual intervention
may be needed. For these purposes there MUST be a configuration
mechanism that allows users to turn off the automatic prefix
allocation and assignment on a given interface. This setting can be a
part of disabling the entire routing auto-configuration <xref
target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/>.</t>

<t>In addition, there SHOULD be a configuration mechanism that allows
users to specify the prefix that they would like the router to request
for a given interface.  This can be useful, for instance, when a
router is replaced and there is a desire for the new router to be
configured to ask for the same prefix as the old one, in order to
avoid renumbering other devices on this network.</t>

<t>Finally, there SHOULD be mechanisms to display the prefixes 
assigned on each interface,  and where they came from (manual
configuration, DHCPv6 PD, OSPFv3).</t>
