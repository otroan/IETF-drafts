         Homenet Simple Source Address Dependent Routing (SADR)
                      draft-troan-homenet-sadr-00

Abstract

   A network is multi-homed to several providers.  Each provider assigns
   provider aggregated addresses to the network and apply BCP38 inbound
   filtering.  This document describes how routers in the network uses
   source address dependent routing to ensure that traffic is sent out
   the correct exit given the packets source address.

1.  Introduction

   In a multi-homed homenet like the one in section 3.2.2.2 of [I-D
   .ietf-homenet-arch], a network may be numbered with provider
   aggregated addresses.  If each of the network providers employ BCP38
   filtering, then traffic must be sent out the correct exit, given the
   packet's source address.  In such a scenario each host has multiple
   addresses from each of the providers the network is connected to.
   The host chooses with provider to use based on which source address
   it selects.

   In a network with an arbitrary topology of multiple border routers
   connected to external providers, and multiple internal routers, a
   router must not only forward packets based on the destination address
   but also the source address.  This we call source address dependent
   routing (SADR).

   A border router has one or more WAN interfaces connecting it to one
   or more Service Providers.  The interfaces may be "real" or "virtual"
   in the case of tunneling technology.  The border router receives one
   or more delegated prefixes, each associated with one or more WAN
   interfaces.

   WAN interfaces are used to send ingress traffic from the Internet to
   the End-User, and egress traffic from the End-User network to the
   Internet.  Ingress traffic may be received on any active interface at
   any time.  Egress traffic follows a set of rules within the router in
   order to choose the proper WAN interface.  This is important not only
   in order to choose the best path, but also because the networks that
   the router are connected to typically employ source address
   verification mechanisms.

   SADR is similar to policy based routing, and this memo proposes a
   simple extension to the destination based longest match algorithm to
   constrain it to source address.

   This document describes a solution to the SADR problem in the context
   of a home network that is using OSPFv3 prefix assignment as described
   in [I-D.arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment].

3.  Terminology

   Border Router           A Source Address Routing Information Base
                           containing an entry per delegated prefix.
                           Each entry points to one or more Destination
                           Address Routing Tables (DRIB).

   Internal Router         A Destination Address Routing Information
                           Base used for destination address longest
                           matching lookups.  Each entry points to one
                           or more next-hops.

4.  Source Address Dependent Routing in the Home Network

   In a destination based routing table, an entry in the routing table
   can be shown as "D -> NH".  That is, to get to a destination D, use
   next-hop NH.  For a source constrained routing table we propose the
   following notation.  (Source network, Destination network) -> Next-
   hop.  (S,D) -> NH.  A route that is not source constrained can be
   represented as (D, *) -> NH.

   For convenience this document shows the routing table as a single
   destination based routing table, with source address constrained
   paths.  This does not preclude other implementations, as long as the
   external behaviour is the same.

   A router forwarding a packet does a longest match lookup on the
   destination address.  If this is a (D,*) entry, it forwards the
   packet out the best next-hop as before (doing equal cost multi path
   load balancing etc).  If the lookup results in a (D, S) entry, the
   lookup function does a longest match on the source address among the
   set of (D, S) paths.  If there is a match the packet is forwarded out
   the given next-hop, if not an ICMP destination address unreachable
   message is returned.  A routing entry may have both (D,S) paths and
   (D,*) paths.  The longest match wins.

   The following example show the routing table of a network connected
   to two ISPs, ISP A and ISP B. Both ISPs offer default connectivity
   and ISP B also offers a more specific route to a walled garden
   service.

    (2001:db8::/56, ::/0) -> ISP_A          # Default route to ISP A
    (2001:db9::/56, ::/0) -> ISP_B          # Default route to ISP B
    (*, 2001:db8::/64) -> R1                # Internal network, prefix from A
    (*, 2001:db8:1::/64) -> R2              # Internal network, prefix from A
    (*, 2001:db9::/64) -> R1                # Internal network, prefix from B
    (*, 2001:db9:1::/64) -> R2              # Internal network, prefix from B
    (*, fd00::/64) -> R3                    # Internal network ULA
    (2001:db9::/56, 2001:420::/32) -> ISP_B # Walled garden route from ISP B
   

                    Figure 1: Example Routing Table

   A packet with the SA,DA of 2001:db8::1, 2001:dead:beef::1 would be
   forwarded to ISP A, likewise a packet with SA, DA 2001:db9::1,
   2001:dead:beef::1 would be forward to ISP B. An packet with SA,DA
   2001:db8::1, 2001:db9::1 would be forwarded using normal destination
   based routing.  A packet to the walled garden SA,DA 2001:db9::1,
   2001:420::1 would be sent to ISP B. A packet with SA,DA
   2001:db8::1,2001:420::1 would be dropped with an ICMP unreachable
   message being sent back.

5.  Routing considerations

   Now that we have described the function of the source constrained
   routing table.  How does the table get populated?  The generic answer
   is that the routing protocol used in the network has to be extended
   to support (D,S) routes.

   In the home network it is possible to take advantage of the fact that
   the source constrained prefix is available as part of the prefix
   assignment mechanism.  An internal router can combine the information
   learnt from prefix assignment with the External routes being learnt
   in the routing protocol advertisements.

   All routers are running OSPFv3 with the extensions for auto-
   configuration and prefix assignment.  A border router typically
   advertises a default route and any other external routes that it has
   learnt (e.g.  with RFC4191) into the OSPFv3 domain.  These routes are
   advertised in an AS-External LSA, [RFC5340].

   An internal router when receiving a AS-External LSA route will
   install that in the routing table as normal.  When the internal
   router receives a usable prefix as part of prefix assignment, the
   router shall add source constrained entries to all the AS-External
   routes received from the same border router (matching router-ID).

   Routes that are not associcated with a border router or is not AS-
   External do not have source constrained paths.

5.1.  Routing protocol requirements

   1.  Routing protocol must flood all information to all routers in the
       home network.

   2.  Prefix assignment and unicast routing must be done in the same
       protocol.

   3.  A router must be uniquely identified (router-id) so that router
       advertisements and prefix assignment can be tied together

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any IANA actions.
