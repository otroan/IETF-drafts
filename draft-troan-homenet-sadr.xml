    <abstract>
      <t>A network is multi-homed to several providers. Each provider
      assigns provider aggregated addresses to the network and apply
      BCP38 inbound filtering. This document describes how routers in
      the network uses source address dependent routing to ensure that
      traffic is sent out the correct exit given the packets source
      address.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In a multi-homed homenet like the one in section 3.2.2.2 of
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-homenet-arch"/>, a network may be
      numbered with provider aggregated addresses. If each of the
      network providers employ BCP38 filtering, then traffic must be
      sent out the correct exit, given the packet's source address. In
      such a scenario each host has multiple addresses from each of
      the providers the network is connected to. The host chooses with
      provider to use based on which source address it selects.</t>

      <t>In a network with an arbitrary topology of multiple border
      routers connected to external providers, and multiple internal
      routers, a router must not only forward packets based on the
      destination address but also the source address. This we call
      source address dependent routing (SADR).</t>

      <t>A border router has one or more WAN interfaces connecting it
      to one or more Service Providers. The interfaces may be "real"
      or "virtual" in the case of tunneling technology. The border
      router receives one or more delegated prefixes, each associated
      with one or more WAN interfaces.</t>

      <t>WAN interfaces are used to send ingress traffic from the
      Internet to the End-User, and egress traffic from the End-User
      network to the Internet. Ingress traffic may be received on any
      active interface at any time. Egress traffic follows a set of
      rules within the router in order to choose the proper WAN
      interface. This is important not only in order to choose the
      best path, but also because the networks that the router are
      connected to typically employ source address verification
      mechanisms.</t>

      <t>SADR is similar to policy based routing, and this memo
      proposes a simple extension to the destination based longest
      match algorithm to constrain it to source address.</t>

      <t>This document describes a solution to the SADR problem in the
      context of a home network that is using OSPFv3 prefix assignment
      as described in <xref
      target="I-D.arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment"/>.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 3: DESCRIPTION                   -->

    <section title="Source Address Dependent Routing in the Home Network">
      <t>In a destination based routing table, an entry in the routing
      table can be shown as "D -> NH". That is, to get to a
      destination D, use next-hop NH. For a source constrained routing
      table we propose the following notation. (Source network,
      Destination network) -> Next-hop. (S,D) -> NH. A route that is
      not source constrained can be represented as (D, *) -> NH.</t>

      <t>For convenience this document shows the routing table as a
      single destination based routing table, with source address
      constrained paths. This does not preclude other implementations,
      as long as the external behaviour is the same.</t>

      <t>A router forwarding a packet does a longest match lookup on
      the destination address. If this is a (D,*) entry, it forwards
      the packet out the best next-hop as before (doing equal cost
      multi path load balancing etc). If the lookup results in a (D,
      S) entry, the lookup function does a longest match on the source
      address among the set of (D, S) paths. If there is a match the
      packet is forwarded out the given next-hop, if not an ICMP
      destination address unreachable message is returned. A routing
      entry may have both (D,S) paths and (D,*) paths. The longest
      match wins.</t>

      <t>The following example show the routing table of a network
      connected to two ISPs, ISP A and ISP B. Both ISPs offer default
      connectivity and ISP B also offers a more specific route to a
      walled garden service.</t>

 (2001:db8::/56, ::/0) -> ISP_A          # Default route to ISP A

      <t>A packet with the SA,DA of 2001:db8::1, 2001:dead:beef::1
      would be forwarded to ISP A, likewise a packet with SA, DA
      2001:db9::1, 2001:dead:beef::1 would be forward to ISP B. An
      packet with SA,DA 2001:db8::1, 2001:db9::1 would be forwarded
      using normal destination based routing. A packet to the walled
      garden SA,DA 2001:db9::1, 2001:420::1 would be sent to ISP B. A
      packet with SA,DA 2001:db8::1,2001:420::1 would be dropped with
      an ICMP unreachable message being sent back.</t>

    <section title="Routing considerations">
      <t>Now that we have described the function of the source
      constrained routing table. How does the table get populated? The
      generic answer is that the routing protocol used in the network
      has to be extended to support (D,S) routes.</t>

      <t>In the home network it is possible to take advantage of the
      fact that the source constrained prefix is available as part of
      the prefix assignment mechanism. An internal router can combine
      the information learnt from prefix assignment with the External
      routes being learnt in the routing protocol
      advertisements.</t>

      <t>All routers are running OSPFv3 with the extensions for
      auto-configuration and prefix assignment. A border router
      typically advertises a default route and any other external
      routes that it has learnt (e.g. with RFC4191) into the OSPFv3
      domain. These routes are advertised in an AS-External LSA, <xref
      target="RFC5340"/>.</t>

      <t>An internal router when receiving a AS-External LSA route
      will install that in the routing table as normal. When the
      internal router receives a usable prefix as part of prefix
      assignment, the router shall add source constrained entries to
      all the AS-External routes received from the same border router
      (matching router-ID).</t>

      <t>Routes that are not associcated with a border router or is
      not AS-External do not have source constrained paths.</t>

      <section title="Routing protocol requirements">
	<t><list style="numbers">
	  <t>Routing protocol must flood all information to all routers in the home network.</t>
	  <t>Prefix assignment and unicast routing must be done in the same protocol.</t>
	  <t>A router must be uniquely identified (router-id) so that
	  router advertisements and prefix assignment can be tied
	  together</t>
